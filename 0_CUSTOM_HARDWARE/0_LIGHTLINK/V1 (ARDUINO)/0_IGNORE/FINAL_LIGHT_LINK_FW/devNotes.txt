Addressable channels:
FR_BUMP_NP --> handles side markers and front bumper lights
HEADLIGHTS_NP --> handles strips inside headlights
TRUNK_NP --> handles front windshield, rear quarter panel, third brake light, and license plate lights
R_BUMP_NP --> handles fourth brake light assy

Light algorithm:
The algorithm assigns states to each light as boolean variables and effectuates these states at the end of each cycle.
This allows various effectors to sequentially modify the state of each light depending on their relative 'authority' prior to the state being executed.
For example, the brake light task is always executed last to override any light cycle or inferior task.

1. clear all states --> clearLights();
2. handle running light states
3. assign light cycle states
4. assign turn signal states
5. assign brake light states
6. handle brake light flashing
7. execute states --> showLights();
